# Processes
A process might seem a lot like a program, but they are two different things.

The program contains the instructions that you want your machine to execute and the process contains the environment that it needs to be processing those instructions. It maintains and represents the execution of a program.

When you actually run the program or .exe file, it becomes a `process` (or multiple). At this point you initialize an `instance` of the executable program that is being ran, this is the process.

A process has `components` or `resources` that it compromises of or interact with. The [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/about-processes-and-threads) give brief break-down of these components.

Here's a few examples of default applications that start processes:
- MsMpEng (Microsoft Defender)
- wininit (keyboard and mouse)
- lsass (credential storage)

Applications running on your operating system can contain `one or more processes`.

## High-level components
| Component | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `Name` | Define the name of the process, typically inherited from the application. |
| `Status` | Determines how the process is running (running, suspended, etc.) |
| `Private virtual address space` | A set of virtual memory addresses available to be used by the process. |
| `Executable program` | The initial code and data of the executable that is stored into the private virtual address space. |
| `List of open handles` | A list of open handles to be used by the process's threads to interact with system resources. |
| `Security context` | This is the access token that identifies the user, security groups, privileges, attributes, claims, capabilities, UAC virtualization state, session and limited user-account state associated with the process. It also identifies the AppContainer and it's also related to sandboxing information. |
| `User name` | User that initiated the process. Can denote privilege of the process |
| `Process ID (PID)` | A unique identifier for the process. Internally this is part of an identifier named "client ID". |
| `Threads` (of execution) | A process contains at least one thread of execution. |
| `Environment variables` | Metadata used by the process to understand what OS environment it's running in. |
| `Priority class` | Tells the scheduler how often the CPU should look at the threads in this process. |
| `Minimum and maximum working set sizes (RAM)` | The amount of RAM the process can use. |
| `Process state` | The current state of the process like; Created, Terminated, Running, Waiting, Suspended, Blocked, etc. |

## Low-level components
| Component | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `Code` | Code to be executed by the process. |
| `Global Variables` | Stored variables. |
| `Process Heap` | Defines the heap where data is stored. |
| `Process Resources` | Defines further resources of the process. |
| `Process Environment Block` | Data structure to define process information. |

## Threads
In essence, processes aren't even executed by the CPU. The threads inside of the process are executed by the CPU, they typically represent the code.

A `thread` is an `executable unit- or entity` employed by a process and scheduled for execution based on device factors.

When we have a process with two or more threads it's called a Multi-Threaded process. At first programs were Single-Threaded but as CPU's evolved and got multiple cores this gave us a way to get a lot more done with our threads.

Threads may seem like a bare-bones and simple component, but it's `function is critical` to processes. Without this a process wouldn't be able to "run". We can simplify the definition of a thread: `controlling the execution of a process`.

- Device factors can vary based on CPU and memory specifications, priority and logical factors, and others.
- All threads within a process share the process's virtual address space and system resources, such as code, global variables, etc.

Threads can also switch between eachother to control execution (`context-switching`), commonly seen in multi-threaded applications. However, this involves the kernel scheduler and can become quite expensive. To solve this issue Windows implements two mechanisms to reduce the overhead cost for the CPU:
- `Fibers`
- `User-mode Scheduling (UMS)` 

Threads also have their unique values and architecture-specific components called the `Thread context`. The Windows `GetThreadContext` function provides access to this `architecture-specific structure (context block)`.

### Thread context
| Component | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `Context Structure` or `Volatile registers` | Holds a set of CPU registers that represent the state of the processor maintained by the kernel. |
| `Two stacks` | All data relevant and specific to the thread (exceptions, procedure calls, etc.). One to execute Kernel-mode and one for User-mode execution. |
| `Thread-Local Storage` (TLS) | A private storage area (a unique data environment) used for allocation by sub-systems, run-time libraries and DLLs. |
| `Thread ID` or `Stack Argument` | Unique value (identifier) assigned to each thread, part of the `client ID structure`. |
| `Security context` | Sometimes threads have their own security context or token. Commonly used by multi-threaded server applications that clone the security context of their served client. |
| `Priority class` | Representing the priority of the execution of the thread. |

## Fibers
Think of fibers like a lightweight thread that you control / schedule yourself. Fibers are invisible to the kernel because they're implemented in user mode in Kernel32.dll, making scheduling of execution manual rather than relying on Windows priority-based scheduling mechanism.

In most cases, letting Windows manage threads automatically is a better choice over managing User-mode fibers manually.

### Fibers limitations
1. You start with a normal thread and call `ConvertThreadToFiber`. This function converts the thread to a running fiber.
2. You can make more fibers using `CreateFiber`. Each fiber can have it's own set of fibers.
3. Instead of Windows deciding which fiber runs, you call `SwitchToFiber` to manually choose which fiber gets to execute.
4. The new fiber runs until it exits or until it calls SwitchToFiber, again selecting another fiber to run.

### Downsides of fibers
- Invisible to the kernel: Since the operating system doesn’t know fibers exist, it can’t schedule them properly. This can lead to bad performance.
- TLS issues: Sharing thread local storage (TLS) can be an issue because several fibers can be running on the same thread.
- No True Multithreading: Fibers don’t run on multiple processors at the same time, they are limited to cooperative multi-tasking only. Only one fiber runs per thread.
- Poor I/O performance: Fiber local storage (FLS) exists but doesn't solve all the issues. If a fiber is waiting on a file or network request, the entire thread is stuck waiting.

<summary> User-mode structure </summary>

```C
typedef struct _NT_FIBER {
    PVOID FiberData;         // Pointer to user-defined fiber-specific (storage) data, similar to TLS
    struct _NT_FIBER *Self;  // Self-reference for integrity checks
    PVOID StackBase;         // Base of the fiber’s stack (highest memory address)
    PVOID StackLimit;        // Stack limit (where stack grows towards)
    PVOID DeallocationStack; // Pointer to memory reserved for stack deallocation
    CONTEXT FiberContext;    // CPU register state for fiber switching
    BOOLEAN FiberFlags;      // Flags (e.g.: Is this the primary fiber?) + other metadeta
} NT_FIBER, *PNT_FIBER;
```

</details>

## User-mode Scheduling threads
User-mode scheduling (UMS) threads, which are available only on 64-bit versions of Windows are an improved version of fibers, with fewer downsides.

They still allow programs to manage their own scheduling instead of relying entirely on the Windows scheduler. However, UMS threads have their own kernel thread state, because of that they are visible to the kernel in contrast to fibers. 

This visibility to the kernel means:
- Allow multiple UMS threads to issue system calls that block execution (e.g.: waiting for file access).
- Share and manage resources properly, unlike fibers.

### How UMS Threads work
- When multiple UMS threads need to run in user mode, they can switch between each other without involving the Windows scheduler.
- From the kernel’s perspective, it looks like the same thread is still running, even though UMS threads are switching internally.
- When a UMS thread needs to enter the kernel (e.g., making a system call), it temporarily switches to a dedicated kernel-mode thread (this is called a directed context switch).
- Every thread in a process shares the same virtual address space, meaning they can read and write the same memory.
- Threads cannot access another process’s memory unless:
    - The other process explicitly shares memory (e.g., using a file mapping object).
    - The process has special permissions (e.g., using ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory).

### UMS Threads limitations
- UMS threads still can't run on multiple processors at the same time.
- However, they do follow a pre-emptible model, meaning they aren't purely cooperative like fibers (they can be interrupted if needed).

## Services
A service is a process that is designed to perform a specific service for the operating system. These processes get started by the Windows `service control manager (SCM)` and are usually background processes.

Since it runs in the background it doesn't have a GUI or require any interaction from the user.

They run independently of user sessions and provide essential system functions, such as networking, printing, and security. They can start automatically, manually, or on demand.

### Types of services
| System services critical to the OS | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `wininit.exe` | Windows Initialization |
| `lsass.exe` | Local Security Authority |
| `services.exe` | Service Control Manager |

| Networking Services to manage connections | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `Dhcp` | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol |
| `Dnscache` | DNS Client Service |
| `LanmanServer` | File Sharing & Network Services |

| Security Services to protect the system | purpose |
|-|-|
| WinDefend | Windows Defender Antivirus |
| EventLog | Windows Event Logging |
| W32Time | Windows Time Synchronization |

| Hardware Services to manage devices | purpose |
|-|-|
| Spooler | Print Spooler |
| PlugPlay | Plug and Play service |
| AudioSrv | Windows Audio |

| Application Services installed by third-party apps | purpose |
|-|-|
| SQL Server | MSSQLSERVER database services |
| Apache or Nginx | Web server services |
| VMware or VirtualBox | OS virtualization |

## Child-Parent processes
It's also possible for processes to create / initialize other processes. The process that created the other is called the `parent process`. The process that got created is called the `child process`.

E.g: explorer.exe initializing a msedge.exe process that initializes multiple other msedge.exe processes.

```bash
explorer.exe
└── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    ├── msedge.exe
    └── msedge.exe
```

## Handles
When threads are being run they often require system resources like registry keys, files, folders, session information, etc.

A handle is basically a declaration from the thread saying that this system resource is being used by the process. 

> [!NOTE]
> A handle makes the specified system resource solely available to it's process.
> 
> It acts as if it's in a locked state from the perspective of outside processes.
>
> If you've ever tried to delete a file that's still open in some process like Word you'd get a message saying: "This action can't be completed because the file is open in Word.".

## Jobs / Job Object
A job (object) in Windows is a management structure that groups multiple processes together into a singular unit. It allows the system (or an administrator) to control and apply limits (e.g., CPU, memory, I/O) to all processes inside the job as a single unit.

- When a process is assigned to a job, it cannot leave the job unless explicitly allowed.
- If a job is terminated, all processes inside it are also terminated.
- Jobs are often used in server environments to control resource usage for groups of processes.

A job can:
- Apply limits to processes inside the job (e.g., memory, CPU usage).
- Monitor and track resource usage for all processes in the job.
- Control process behavior, such as preventing them from creating new processes outside the job.

Essentially, job objects make up for the lack of a structured process tree (unlike UNIX, where processes naturally have parent-child relationships). But jobs are actually more powerful because they allow fine-tuned control over multiple processes at once.

## Named pipes
Named pipes are just a mechanism for two processes to talk to eachother. This comes with another more windows-specific vulnerability; name squatting.

1. Create a named pipe that is used for client-server communication.
2. Start a client that uses said pipe.
3. Use client impersonation to get client priveleges.

## Process creation in the kernel
The steps the kernel takes to create a process are:
1. Initialize the process address space
    - Map `KUSER_SHARED_DATA`, read-only shared memory used for system time, tick count, and other global data.
    - Map the `executable`, Loads the program file into memory.
    - Map `ntdll.dll`, This library is essential for `system calls`, so it’s always mapped into the process.
    - Allocate the [PEB](/Windows_Internals/Virtual_Memory.md#peb), Stores information like command-line arguments, loaded modules, and heap details.
2. Create the initial thread
   - Allocate the stack(s), each thread gets a user-mode stack and a kernel-mode stack.
   - Allocate the [TEB](/Windows_Internals/Virtual_Memory.md#teb), stores per-thread information like thread ID, exception handling data, and TLS slots.
   - Set the instruction pointer to `ntdll.LdrInitializeThunk`, instead of directly executing the program, the thread first runs a function in ntdll.dll to prepare the environment.
     - Handles dynamic DLL loading → Loads required DLLs like kernel32.dll, user32.dll, etc.
     - Processes TLS Callbacks → Calls thread-local storage (TLS) initializers.
     - Calls DllMain for loaded DLLs → If a DLL has a DllMain function, it gets executed here.
     - Sets up the loader lock → Prevents race conditions during DLL loading.
     - Performs a system call: `ZwContinue` → A system call that resumes execution in a new thread context, transferring control to `RtlUserThreadStart`.

   - `RtlUserThreadStart`: calls `kernel32.BaseThreadInitThunk` transferring to User-mode.
   - `BaseThreadInitThunk`:
      - Sets up SEH (structured exception handling).
      - Calls `mainCRTStartup(PEB)`.
   - `mainCRTStartup(PEB)` (provided by the C runtime library):
calls `main(argc, argv)` (for C programs) or `WinMain` (for Windows GUI applications).

> [!NOTE]
> The PEB and TEB are part of a process’s virtual address space in memory. Don't confuse a process's [Virtual Memory Components](/Windows_Internals/Virtual_Memory.md) with process components.
