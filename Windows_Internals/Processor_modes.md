# Processor modes
The Windows operating system has a `user mode` and a `kernel mode`. This security measure is implemented through processor `acces modes` and `privilege levels`. Some processors might use terms like `code privilege level`, `ring level`, `supervisor mode` and `application mode`.

An application by default cannot interact with the kernel or modify critical OS data. This is a safety mechanism that ensures that User-mode applications won't disrupt the stability of the system. 

 The processor will switch between these modes `depending on access and requested mode`. Even if the processor supports multiple modes, Windows will only ever use two for compatibility reasons with other operating systems.

| User mode | Kernel Mode |
|-|-|
| No direct hardware access | Direct hardware access |
| Creates a process in a private virtual address space | Ran in a single shared virtual address space |
| Access to "owned memory locations" in the VAS | access to all system memory and all CPU instructions |
| Runs user application code | Runes OS code |

## Privilidge levels
You might have noticed that these modes like user-mode and kernel-mode provide different priviledges associated with the mode. As a general rule: user-mode has access to anything that's withing userland or user-space: `ring 3`. Essentially, kernel-mode has access to everything: `ring 0`.

> [!NOTE]
> x86 and x86-64 processors define four rings. 
>
> Again, Windows will only use two for: compatibility reasons, efficiency and portability and because the other x86/x86-x64 ring levels do not provide the same guarantees.

## System calls and the Switching Point
Applications that start in `user mode` (also known as `userland`) remain in that mode until they make a `system call (syscall)` or interact with the OS via an API. When a syscall occurs, the application transitions into kernel mode to execute privileged operations.

> [!NOTE]
> User-mode has many terms; User-mode, userspace, userland, etc.
>
> Userland is a common term, however, it's not a term defined by Windows.

- User applications switch to kernel mode when making system calls (e.g., `ReadFile`).
- A special processor instruction triggers this transition, allowing access to protected system structures in `Ntoskrnl.exe` or `Win32k.sys`.
- The processor switches back to user mode before returning control to the application, ensuring system protection.
- Mode transitions are not context switches and do not affect thread scheduling.
- Graphics-intensive apps spend more time in kernel mode since the windowing system runs there.
- Newer technologies like `Direct2D` and `DirectComposition` reduce kernel mode time by handling more computations in user mode before passing data to the kernel.

### Syscall naming conventions
System calls in Windows are often prefixed with `Nt`, which stands for `Windows New Technology (NT)`. These calls are the lower-level APIs used internally by the OS. However, some system calls use the `Zw` prefix. While `Zw` has no official meaning, it was chosen to avoid naming conflicts with other APIs and to preserve other useful two-letter prefixes for future use.

Additionally, many Windows driver support routines use standardized prefixes that indicate which kernel-mode system component implements them:
| Prefix | Kernel component | Example routine |
|-|-|-|
| `Cm` | Configuration manager | `CmRegisterCallbackEx` |
| `Ex` | Executive | `ExAllocatePool` |
| `Hal` | Hardware abstraction layer | `HalGetAdapter` |
| `Io` | I/O manager | `IoAllocateIrp` |
| `Ke` | Kernel core | `KeSetEvent` |
| `Mm` | Memory manager | `MmUnlockPages` |
| `Ob` | Object manager | `ObReferenceObject` |
| `Po` | Power manager | `PoSetPowerState` |
| `Tm` | Transaction manager | `TmCommitTransaction` |
| `Nt` and `Zw` | Native system services | `NtCreateFile` and `ZwCreateFile` |

### The Switching Point
The `switch between user mode and kernel mode` is facilitated by `system and API calls`. In some documentation, this transition is referred to as the `Switching Point`.

### Performance Counters for Mode Transitions
The following performance counters help track the time spent in user and kernel modes:

| Object | Counter | Function |
|-|-|-|
| Processor | % Privileged Time | Percentage of time that an individual CPU (or all CPUs) has run in kernel mode during a specified interval. |
| Processor | % User Time | Percentage of time that an individual CPU (or all CPUs) has run in user mode during a specified interval. |
| Process | % Privileged Time | Percentage of time that the threads in a process have run in kernel mode during a specified interval. |
| Process | % User Time | Percentage of time that the threads in a process have run in user mode during a specified interval. |
| Thread | % Privileged Time | Percentage of time that a thread has run in kernel mode during a specified interval. |
| Thread | % User Time | Percentage of time that a thread has run in user mode during a specified interval. |

## The kernel
The `kernel` itself refers specifically to the OS core that enforces rules and handles system-wide operations. You could see it as the "heart" of the operating system. 

Essentially, it's a software component that sits / interfaces between your hardware and the rest of the OS and software.

Here's a simplified list of what the core kernel component actually does:

-  Manage hardware interaction:

    Abstract away the physical differences between hardware setups by providing other software with a standardized surface area to interface with.

- Privilege Separation:

    Provide a safety mechanism for security and stability by separating user-mode and kernel-mode operations, preventing regular applications from directly accessing hardware.

- Manage processes & memory:

    The kernel handles process creation, scheduling, and termination while also managing memory allocation and enforcing access protections.

- Resource Scheduling & Allocation:

    The kernel decides how CPU time, memory, and I/O resources are distributed among processes.

- Inter-Process Communication (IPC):

    It enables different processes to communicate and share data safely.

- Event Handling & Interrupts:

    The kernel responds to hardware and software interrupts to keep the system running smoothly.

- Handle system calls:

    The kernel provides a controlled way for user-mode applications to request services (e.g., file access, networking, or process management) through system calls.


### Types
| Kernel type | Description | Advantage |
|-|-|-|
| Monolithic kernel | The kernel incorporates most of the OS's main functions. | Higher performance and easier for programmers to work with. |
| Micro-Kernel | The kernel only handles basic functionality leaving other components to the user-space. | Ability to kill problematic processes without crashing the system. |
| Hyrbid kernel | Tries to incorporate the advantage of both modules. | Fast and modular. |

### Memory
Contrary to user-mode virtual address space, kernel-mode and device-driver code share a single virtual address space. Each page in virtual memory is protected with a "tag" that indicates which read and / or write-operation could be used on that memory based on the processor mode.

However, read-only pages that contain static read-only data are not writable from any mode. Additionally, `Data Execution Prevention (DEP)` if enabled stops code from running in memory areas meant for data, preventing exploits like buffer overflows. However, in kernel mode, there are no such protectionsâ€”drivers and system code can access any part of system memory without restrictions.

### Driver signing and security
Since kernel-mode code has full system access, Microsoft enforces strict driver-signing policies to improve security and stability.

- Windows 2000 introduced `driver signing` to warn/block unsigned plug-and-play drivers.
- Windows 8.1 (64-bit & ARM) requires all drivers to be signed by a `recognized certification authority` (`Kernel-Mode Code Signing, KMCS`). Users cannot install unsigned drivers unless they enable "Test Mode."
- Windows 10 (Anniversary Update, 2016) tightened requirements:
    - Drivers must be `SHA-2 EV signed and submitted` to Microsoft for attestation.
    - Only `Microsoft-signed drivers` can load, except in "Test Mode."
    - Pre-2015 signed drivers remain valid for now.
- Windows Server 2016 further restricts drivers, requiring `WHQL certification` for additional security and stability.
- Enterprise configurations (e.g., `Device Guard`) can customize these policies, enforcing stricter requirements where needed.

These measures are an effort by Microsoft to reduce untrusted third-party drivers in kernel memory, strengthening system security.
