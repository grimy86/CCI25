## Content Discovery / Web Walking
| Where to look | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `view-source:`    | Source of the web-app |
| `HTML comments`   | Could contain valuabe info |
| `Editing a style` | E.g: `Display: none` is a common way to hide HTML elements |
| `Breakpoints` | Force the browser to stop processing the JavaScript and pause the current execution |
| Network tab   | Examine network entries, server responses, etc.   |
| `robots.txt`  | Tells search engines which pages they are and aren't allowed to show on their search engine results |
| favicon       | Tells search engines which pages they are and aren't allowed to show on their search engine results, try parse it. |
| `Sitemap.xml` | Sitemap.xml file gives a list of every file the website owner wishes to be listed on a search engine |
| HTTP headers  | Headers can sometimes contain useful information such as the webserver software and possibly the programming/scripting language in use. |

| `Sublist3r` (& `dnsenum`) | Speed up the process of OSINT subdomain discovery, bruteforce, google, etc. |
| `Ffuf` | Test for virtual hosts |


## Subdomain Enumeration
When an `SSL/TLS` certificate is created for a domain by a CA, CA's create publicly accessible logs of every SSL/TLS certificate created for a domain name. The purpose of `Certificate Transparency logs` is to stop malicious and accidentally made certificates from being used. We can use this service to our advantage to discover subdomains belonging to a domain, sites like `https://crt.sh` and `https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui` offer a searchable database of certificates that shows current and historical results.

## Bruteforce DNS enumeration
Trying tens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of different possible subdomains from a pre-defined list of commonly used subdomains.
E.g: `admin.example.com` or `staging.example.com`

Note: this IS `NOT like go/dirbuster`, they focus on directories and files so `example.com/directory` or `example.com/file.extension`.

Note: `Sublist3r` automates this process and does some google dorking too.

## Virtual Hosts
A web server can host multiple websites on the same IP address. It uses the Host header in the HTTP request to figure out which website to serve.

Example: Server at 192.168.1.1 hosts: `example.com` & `admin.example.com`

Some subdomains aren't always hosted in publically accessible DNS results, such as development versions of a web application or administration portals.
Instead, the DNS record could be kept on a private DNS server or recorded on the developer's machines in their `Linux: /etc/hosts file` or `Windows: c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` which maps domain names to IP addresses.

Because web servers can host multiple websites from one server when a website is requested from a client, the server knows which website the client wants from the Host header. We can `utilise this host header by making changes to it` and monitoring the response to see if we've discovered a new website.

Like with DNS Bruteforce, we can automate this process by using a `wordlist of commonly used subdomains`.

## Passive recon
In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. Think of it like you are looking at target territory from afar without stepping foot on that territory.

Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance:
- Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
- Checking job ads related to the target website.
- Reading news articles about the target company.

| Tool | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Whois | request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification. A WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. The WHOIS server replies with various information related to the domain requested. Of particular interest, we can learn. | `Registrar`, `Contact info` of registrant, `Creation-, Update- and Expiration dates`, `Name Server` |
| nslookup | Find the IP address of a domain name using nslookup, which stands for Name Server Look Up. | `nslookup -type=[A(ipv4) or AAAA(ipv6)m CNAME, MX, SOA, TXT] [DOMAIN_NAME] [SERVER].` |
|  |  |  |

## Active reconnaissance
Cannot be achieved so discreetly as it requires direct engagement with the target. Think of it like you check the locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points.

Examples of active reconnaissance activities include:
- Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
- Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering).
- Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.
