# REST API (Representational State Transfer)
A REST API is a type of `Web API` that follows specific principles.

## Principles
- Stateless

    The server `doesn’t remember` past requests. Each request must contain all necessary information (authentication, data, etc.).

    Example: If you send a GET /profile, the server won’t remember who you are unless you include authentication (like a `token`).

- Client-Server Architecture

    The client (frontend, mobile app, etc.) and the server (backend) are separate, communicating via HTTP.

- Resource-Based

    Data is treated as resources identified by URLs (e.g., /users, /products).

    Example: GET /users/1 → Fetch user with ID 1.

- Uses HTTP Methods
    - GET → Retrieve data
    - POST → Create new data
    - PUT → Update existing data
    - DELETE → Remove data

- Uses JSON (or XML) for Data Exchange

    Example response:
    ```JSON
    {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
    }
    ```
- Stateless Authentication (e.g., JWT tokens, API keys, OAuth)

    Users authenticate once (e.g., login with email/password), and the API provides a token that must be sent in each request.

## Comparing REST API to Other Web APIs
| API Type | Protocol | Format | Stateless? | Use Case |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| REST | HTTP | JSON | Yes | Web & mobile apps |
| SOAP | HTTP, SMTP | XML | No | Enterprise apps (banking, payments) |
| GraphQL | HTTP | JSON | Yes | Dynamic queries (Facebook, GitHub API) |

## What You Need to Know as a Developer
- HTTP Basics: Understand how HTTP methods, status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error), and headers work.
- JSON Format: Learn how to work with JSON (serialize/deserialize in C#, etc.).
- Authentication: Understand API authentication mechanisms like JWT, OAuth, API keys.
- Tools for testing APIs: Postman, Curl, burno, etc.
- Building REST APIs: ASP.NET core, Express.js, Flask, Spring boot, etc.
- Security: Rate limiting, API gateways, input validation, preventing SQL injection/XSS.
