/*
# Access or Visiblity modifiers
By default everything within a `class is private` and everything within a `struct is public`.
However, you can use following `access modifiers` to change the visibility to other translation units.

## Private
Only this class and its Friend class can access Private attributes.

## Protected
Only this class and its subclasses can access Protected attributes.

## Public
Everything can access Public attributes.
