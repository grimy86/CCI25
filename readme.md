# Cybersecurity & Code Insights '25

**An open-source guide / summary / insights combining x86 assembly, x86-64 assembly, C++ and cybersecurity operations into a unified learning resource.**

**ðŸ›  Prerequisites :** 
No prior knowledge is needed. However, if you are starting from the ground up I would recommend following path:


```mermaid
graph TD;
	cpp[Study C++ & how memory works] --> x86[x86 assembly]
	x86 --> x86-64[x86-64 assembly]
	x86-64 --> offsec[offensive cybersecurity fundamentals]
	offsec --> winint[Windows system internals]
	winint --> PE[PE headers / PE file format]
```


**ðŸ“– Study tips:**
- Add this folder to your windows defender exclusions as it might remove valuable resources.
- Don't jump from topic to topic unless you know what you're doing. Most of the "steps" build on top of eachother.
- Install add-ons like [dark reader](https://darkreader.org/) and [remove HTML elements](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/remove-html-elements/enegojdnkeicfoiknhfjaedhlckeahmf?hl=en&pli=1) that make reading better.

## 1. Core programming and assembly foundations
### 1.1 C-style C++
A C-style C++ summary of 2024. This summary is entirely possible thanks to the authors of the Learncpp website (Alex, Nascardriver and James C.) who made their knowledge available for public use.

### 1.2 x86 & x86-64 assembly
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the references / material are for the MASM32 SDK and some are for NASM.
>
> [Example masm program](/Programming_Foundations/Assembly/Examples/hello_world.asm)
>
> [Example nasm program](/Programming_Foundations/Assembly/Examples/hello_world_nasm.asm)

> [!NOTE]
> To compile NASM on windows download [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) & [w64devkit-x86](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
> 
> Use NASM to assemble the .asm file into an object file (.obj). Run this command in the same directory where the .asm file is located:
> ```nasm -f win32 -o fileName.obj fileName.asm```
>
> Use GCC to link the .obj file and create the final executable (.exe). Run this command:
> ```gcc -mconsole -nostartfiles -o fileName.exe fileName.obj```
