# Read Team Fundamentals
- A penetration tester is tasked to carry out conventional vulnerability assessments.
- A red teamer is tasked to go beyond a pentest and carry out an actual simulated attack.

## Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Tests Limitations
This is the simplest form of security assessment.
A vulnerability assessment focuses on scanning hosts for vulnerabilities as individual entities so that security deficiencies can be `identified` and effective security measures can be deployed to `protect` the network in a prioritized manner.
Most of the work can be done with automated tools and performed by operators without requiring much technical knowledge.
